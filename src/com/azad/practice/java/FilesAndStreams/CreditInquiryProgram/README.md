# Credit-Inquiry Program
The program allows a credit manager to obtain lists of 
customers with zero balances (i.e., customers who do not owe any money), 
customers with credit balances (i.e., customers to whom the company owes money)
and customers with debit balances (i.e., customers who owe the company money 
for goods and services received). A credit balance is a negative amount, 
a debit balance a positive amount.

The options and their values are listed in lines 7â€“10.
